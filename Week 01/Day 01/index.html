                        tried a lot in my life.<br>One of the most exciting 
                        thing in my life was living in Sweden. The last two 
                        years have been a fantastic and challenging time 
                        when I faced new kind of difficulties - and thrived 
                        -, learned a whole new language and got to know a 
                        lot of new people, things and job. <font size></p>

                <h3>Santa's hard times</h3>
                
                <p>It is really not easy these days for Santa to deliver the 
                        presents and coal for all the kids in the world. The simple
                        fact that humanity has grown <em>over 7 billion people</em>
                        sure does not help him in his seasonal work. But let's face 
                        some other diffisulties:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Religion - Face it: You have no idea what does Santa do with 
                            the pagan or the little muslim pops!</li>
                    <li>Culture - Who said there is a uniform definition for 
                            "good kid"?</li>
                    <li>Faith - Does they really <em>want</em> Santa to come? 
                            Do they believe?</li>

                </ul>
